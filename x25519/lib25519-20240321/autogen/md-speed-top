In the following speed table, smaller numbers are better.
The numbers are median single-core cycle counts on various microarchitectures.
Overclocking is disabled.

The table reports cycle counts from lib25519 and, for comparison,
OpenSSL and s2n-bignum.
For comparability to OpenSSL's speed-testing utility,
the OpenSSL cycle counts omit various OpenSSL overheads; see below for details.
The s2n-bignum and lib25519 cycle counts include all overheads.
There is also a lib25519+s2n line showing separate measurements of lib25519
after the optional pre-configuration `./use-s2n-bignum` step.
